					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>In our data story, we will analyze how bad weather might affect different aspects of the film industry of the United States, 
					   from overall revenue to per genre distributions. Who knows, maybe everyone enjoys the warmth and coziness of a romance movie more 
					   when it is pouring or heavily snowing outside!</p>
					<h2>A little bit about the data</h2>
					<p>The CMU Movie Summary Corpus provides metadata about movies released between 1893 and 2012. It provides us with a wide range of
						movie data, from box office revenue to a list of movie genres. On the other hand, the weather datasets from the National Oceanic 
						and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are significantly more reliable the more recent the date. To balance out these two datasets, 
						we chose to use the data range from 1992-2012 and restrict our data to be for the United States only, since weather is well
						documented there.
					</p>
					<p>But before we delve too deep into the details of the analysis, let's take a quick look at the datasets!</p>

							<h3>What about indie movies?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>We all have some movie that is a definite must-see once it gets released, whether that
						   was the Barbie and Oppenheimer dual release or the latest Studio Ghibli film: The Boy
						   and the Heron. However, not all movies that we watch fall under that category. Sometimes,
						   we make the decision to do something else – eat out, stay at home, or go out with friends – 
						   rather than go to the movies. When exactly do we make these sacrifices? Most likely,
						   when the movie isn't famous enough for us to watch immediately.
						</p>
						<p>Most of the famous movies we can think of are from major film studios. Just to list a few,
						   there's Universal Studios, with its theme park in Los Angeles as well, and Fox Studios, with
						   its classic beams of light shining on the large statue of "FOX". These famous film studios come
						   with many perks, such as a huge production budget and better film promotion.
						</p>
						<p>So let's put it into perspective: just how much more revenue do movies from major films
						   generate? Well, have a look below:
						</p>
						<iframe class="responsive-plot" src="plots/studios_bo_comparison.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
						<p>In case the stark drop in mean revenue for the indie films weren't enough as an answer, the answer:
						   a lot more. We can even do a t-test if you still aren't convinced. Doing a test on the distribution
						   of revenue for all the major film studio releases against the distribution of the indie films, we
						   get a p-value of \(6.98\cdot 10^{-98}\) which we will just call \(0\).

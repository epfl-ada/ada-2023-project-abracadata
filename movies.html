						<h2>The Movie Dataset</h2>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>The CMU Movie Summary Corpus contains hundreds of thousands of movies and a lot of their metadata.
						   Given that we are only trying to analyze the effect of weather on movie revenue (along with some
						   deeper dives), we only need to look into a few aspects of movies.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<header>
							<p>First and Foremost: Revenue</p>
						</header>
						<p>Seeing as we want to compare the success of movies, it's a given that we need the revenue! However,
						   the data that we are working with is quite old (1992!), we have to factor in inflation to get an accurate
						   estimation of box office revenues over a span of 20 years.
						</p>
						<p>If that didn't convince you, think about it this way: $1 in 1992 was worth $1.64 in 2012. That's over a 150%
						   increase. This means that all the box office revenues reported in 1992 would only be accurate to those reported
						   in 2012 if we multiply them by 1.64.
						</p>
						<p>
							The following plot shows the difference between both the revenue corrected for inflation, and the original
							revenue values. Since regularly plotting the revenue leads to an extremely heavy-tailed distribution, as most
							values are around \(10^8\) in price, we graphed it using a loglog plot.
						</p>
						<iframe class="responsive-plot" src="plots/revenue_distribution.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
						<p>
							A quick t-test confirms the need for inflation correction, with the p-value for the t-test between both revenue distributions
							yielding a value of \(1.68\cdot 10^{-10} \ll 0.05\). 
						</p>

							<p>Next Up: What is Each Movie About?</p>
						</header>
						<p>Movies each have their own set of genres, but some might be more popular than others. Furthermore, each genre
						   might have a different audience with a different preference for weather. You may not have noticed, but you probably know some
						   people who enjoy a good romance movie when it's raining out (to soothe the weather depression), or some crazy ones
						   who think that rain and thunder is a perfect moment for a scary horror movie.
						</p>
						<p>Just for fun, here's a word cloud to show which genres are the most popular choices for movie releases between 1992 and 2012!</p>
						<img class="smaller-img" src="plots/genre_wordcloud.png" alt="Genre Wordcloud">
						<p>It's no surprise that drama, comedy, and action are all among the top genres released. Just think about the last movie
						   you recall hearing about â€“ there's a high chance it falls into at least one of those three categories.
						</p>
						<p>If we take another look at the word cloud, we can notice one other issue: there are too many genres. To help mitigate this
						   issue, we aggregated similar genres under the same umbrella as follows:

						<p>One interesting aspect of the distribution of genres is the steep drop between the first
						   two most popular genres, drama and comedy, and the rest of the genres that are released.

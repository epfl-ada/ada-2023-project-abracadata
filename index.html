					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>Step into our world of weather and movies! Ever wonder if rain makes people crave a good comedy, or if sunny days boost action movie sales? We're on a mission to find out. Join us as we explore the surprising ways that weather might influence what people watch in theaters across the United States. From stormy nights to sunny afternoons, let's discover how the skies above could shape the movies we love. Ready for a fun adventure into the world of weather and films? Let's go!</p>
					<h2>A little bit about the data</h2>
					<p>The CMU Movie Summary Corpus provides metadata about movies released between 1893 and 2012. It provides us with a wide range of
						movie data, from box office revenue to a list of movie genres. On the other hand, the weather datasets from the National Oceanic 
						and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are significantly more reliable the more recent the date. To balance out these two datasets, 
						we chose to use the data range from 1992-2012 and restrict our data to be for the United States only, since weather is well
						documented there.
					</p>
					<p>But before we delve too deep into the details of the analysis, let's take a quick look at the datasets!</p>

							<h4>Naive Analysis: Matching with Release Date</h4>
						</header>
						<p>Let's start with a basic analysis, or we can call it a naive one. We first remove
						   all of the outliers, namely the films that have too high of a revenue and, symmetrically,
						   too low of a revenue. We then do a matching to pair approximate release dates (within a week),
						   to eliminate any weather differences over extended periods of time. Over a few weeks in October,
						   the weather can change from warm, sunny weather to chilly, fall weather, meaning that when pairing
						   the movies, we should match approximate time of year.

								<h3>When it comes to genres... </h3>
</header>
								<p>
									In exploring the intriguing relationship between weather conditions 
									and movie-going habits, our analysis seeks to uncover whether specific
									 weather patterns have a tangible impact on the popularity of different 
									 film genres. Intuitively, one might expect inclement weather to boost 
									 cinema attendance, as people seek indoor entertainment. But does rainy 
									 weather make audiences gravitate more towards the escapism of fantasy or
									  the thrill of horror? Conversely, do sunny days decrease overall theater 
									  attendance but possibly favor certain genres, like uplifting comedies or action-packed adventures? By examining attendance data against local weather patterns, we aim to unravel these trends, offering a unique perspective on how the elements outside might influence the choice of movies inside the theater. This analysis not only provides insights for movie distributors and theaters but also enriches our understanding of consumer behavior in relation to environmental factors.
								 </p>
                    

								<p>To rigorously test whether bad weather affects different movie genres in varied ways, we conducted a linear regression analysis incorporating interactions between various genres and the 'bad weather' condition. Initially, our regression model included interactions for all available genres. However, this approach faced a challenge: the vast number of genres diluted the observable effect of bad weather, making it difficult to discern clear patterns in the data. Additionally, some interaction coefficients in this comprehensive model were not statistically significant, indicating a lack of consistent influence across all genres.

										<figcaption>The OlS regression results</figcaption>
									</figure>
									To address these complexities, we refined our approach by focusing on the three most frequently watched genres. By limiting our analysis to these key categories, we could more accurately capture the nuances of how weather might differentially impact viewer preferences. This targeted analysis revealed that the influence of bad weather on movie attendance is indeed heterogeneous – it varies significantly depending on the genre. Such findings suggest that while some genres might see a boost in popularity during bad weather, others do not, highlighting the intricate interplay between environmental conditions and entertainment choices.
								</p>

									<img src="images/olstop3.webp" alt="Weather Daily Graph">
									<figcaption>The OlS regression results with top 3 genres</figcaption>
								</figure>

								<p>The regression output indicates that weather status (captured by the variable AVG_WEATHER_STATUS) and its interaction with movie genres can have differing effects on box office performance. Specifically:
									<ol class="default">
										<li> <strong>Genre Interaction:</strong> The coefficient for the interaction between bad weather and the drama genre is negative (-2.534e+07), suggesting that drama movies tend to perform worse at the box office on bad weather days. This could imply that audiences are less inclined to watch heavier, more serious 
											films when the weather is poor, possibly preferring to stay at home or seeking out more uplifting forms of entertainment. </li>
									
											<li><strong>Comedy Genre Interaction</strong>: The coefficient for the comedy genre interaction is positive (4.634e+06), although not statistically significant (p-value 0.112), 
												indicating a possible trend that comedies might perform slightly better or remain unaffected by bad weather. The insignificance could be due to variability in 
												the data or other confounding factors not accounted for in the model. Generally, it is believed that the light-hearted nature of comedies could attract audiences looking for cheer on gloomier days.</li>
									
												<li><strong>Mystery Genre Interaction</strong>: The coefficient for the mystery genre interaction is also positive (6.818e+06) and statistically significant (p-value 0.040), 
													suggesting that mystery films might see a relative increase in attendance during bad weather. This effect could be attributed to the atmospheric and engaging
													 nature of mystery films, which may be a compelling draw for audiences on days with inclement weather.</li>

							<h3>Does genre affect attendance?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Everyone has their own opinion about when is the best time to watch certain movie genres.
						   Don't believe us?

							<h3>What about indie movies?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>We all have some movie that is a definite must-see once it gets released, whether that
						   was the Barbie and Oppenheimer dual release or the latest Studio Ghibli film: The Boy
						   and the Heron. However, not all movies that we watch fall under that category. Sometimes,
						   we make the decision to do something else – eat out, stay at home, or go out with friends – 
						   rather than go to the movies. When exactly do we make these sacrifices? Most likely,
						   when the movie isn't famous enough for us to watch immediately.
						</p>
						<p>Most of the famous movies we can think of are from major film studios. Just to list a few,
						   there's Universal Studios, with its theme park in Los Angeles as well, and Fox Studios, with
						   its classic beams of light shining on the large statue of "FOX". These famous film studios come
						   with many perks, such as a huge production budget and better film promotion.
						</p>
						<p>So let's put it into perspective: just how much more revenue do movies from major films
						   generate? Well, have a look below:
						</p>
						<iframe class="responsive-plot" src="plots/studios_bo_comparison.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
						<p>In case the stark drop in mean revenue for the indie films weren't enough as an answer, the answer:
						   a lot more. We can even do a t-test if you still aren't convinced. Doing a test on the distribution
						   of revenue for all the major film studio releases against the distribution of the indie films, we
						   get a p-value of \(6.98\cdot 10^{-98}\) which we will just call \(0\). A p-value this small provides
						   strong evidence against both revenues distributions being equal. A t-statistic of \(21.83\) only serves
						   as further justification for our findings.
						</p>
						<p>We now know that indie films have a drastically lower average revenue than movies released by
						   bigger studios, but we still have yet to figure out: are indie movies more affected by weather?
						</p>
						<p>To answer this question, we isolated the opening weekend for all films and checked how much the proportion
						   of bad weather days affected the distribution of movie revenue. We specifically looked for the opening
						   weekend, as it is usually the most important weekend for all films – a substantial amount of their
						   revenue (\(\sim 25-30\%\)) can be made during the opening weekend. For the following plot, each bad weather day
						   adds 0.5 to the film's "weather condition," placing it into one of four categories along the x-axis.
						</p>
						<iframe class="responsive-plot" src="plots/studios_bo_weather_performance.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
						<p>As it turns out, major studios are actually more affected by weather! What a surprise – or is it? Since
						   blockbusters are often marketed towards a general audience (the more people, the better), they generally
						   have a larger fraction of people who can be called "the casual moviegoer". On the other hand, indie films
						   are lesser known, but with this comes the fact that those who want to watch an indie film are usually
						   avid fans of the studio and will watch the movie, rain or shine. To confirm our observations, we conducted
						   a one sample t-test on both the blockbuster and the indie film distributions, and the t-statistics were
						   \(-0.8253\) and \(-0.7537\), respectively. Although slight, the more negative t-statistic for the blockbusters
						   show us that our observations are correct.

								So...does weather affect movie revenue?
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>That's it! We’ve come to the end of our short data story. We saw how weather does affect movie revenue,
							but it’s split fairly evenly across genres. We also learned the surprising fact that indie films, despite
							their lower popularity, hold up better against bad weather than major blockbusters.</p>

						<p>Now that you know weather has an effect, try testing it yourself! See if your friend group stands up to the
						   test of rainy weather: do more of your friends ditch when it’s rainy? Or do you only plan to go if you know
						   it’s sunny? It’s time to find out!</p>

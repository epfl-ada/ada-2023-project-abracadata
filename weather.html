						<h2>A little about the weather dataset</h2>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>The United States is geographically huge – the weather can differ from state to state, or even city to city! 
						   This brings up the question: how do we generalize the weather to accurately represent the different patterns across
						   the United States?
						</p>
					
						<p>Our solution to this question was to figure out which cities represented the US best in terms of population and movie
						   theater concentration, while still ensuring we captured a proper representation of all weather types present. This gave 
						   us the following 8 cities: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Washington DC, Atlanta, Miami, and Dallas
						   (not ranked in terms of how much we actually like them).
						</p>
						<p>As we delve into the diverse climatic patterns of these cities, we've created an interactive map to enhance your exploration.
						   By hovering over each city on the map, you can see a brief description of their outstanding weather features. From the constant
						   warm weather of Miami to the freezing winters of Chicago and New York, the map allows you to visualize how weather varies across
						   the US. Go ahead – hover over the cities and see it for yourself!
						</p>

						<p>For those who haven't visited all eight cities before, here's a comparison of each of the eight cities and their
						   distributions in terms of precipitation and temperature. Notice how, as expected, Miami is consistently very warm whereas
						   cities like Chicago or New York have a wider distribution and more bad weather days (snow days and cold days).

							<p>What about Natural Disasters?</p>
						</header>
						<p>One thing that we did not take note of was natural disasters. Similar to Iceland's volcanoes, many of these parts of the US have
						   some sort of natural disaster. In Miami and Atlanta, these two cities often experience hurricanes every year. When hurricanes hit,
						   all people in the cities nearest to the southeast coast are forced to evacuate for at least one week. I'm not sure how many people
						   think of going to the theaters when their house is flooded with muddy water, but this definitely can affect sales, especially if the
						   opening weekend falls at the same time as a hurricane landing! Not in the list of cities we analyzed but still a fairly important city, 
						   San Francisco also has its fair share of natural disasters: earthquakes. These don't happen nearly as often as hurricanes, but if 
						   a big earthquake does hit, it can affect a large portion of the area around the epicenter, leading to a definite decrease in movie attendance.

							<p>Our Redefinition of "Average" Temperature</p>
						</header>
						<p>The average temperature calculations are typically calculated using a formula very similar to
						   \(T_{\mathrm{avg}} = \frac12 \cdot T_{\mathrm{high}} + \frac12 \cdot T_{\mathrm{low}}\). However, this assumes that people are active
						   at all times of the day, meaning it will take into consideration days where the morning may be particularly cold but the during the day,
						   the temperature warms up significantly.
						</p>
						<p>To mitigate this effect, we checked a few daily temperature graphs for the cities and found that the trend in daily temperature is roughly
						   the same throughout the day: the coldest time is around 6 AM and the warmest is around 3 PM. We isolated the portion of the graph to when
						   people are most likely to be outside watching movies (highlighted in blue on the graph), especially given movie showtimes.
						</p>
						<figure>

							<figcaption>Temperature Graph for Washington DC – December 20, 2023</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Given this graph, we can see that a better estimate of the average daily temperature for the purposes of our data analysis would be 
						   \(T_{\mathrm{avg}} = \frac23 \cdot T_{\mathrm{high}} + \frac13 \cdot T_{\mathrm{low}}\). This accurately captures how people generally choose
						   afternoon or evening, both warmer times of the day, to watch movies.</p>

						<header>
							<p>What exactly is "good" and "bad" weather? </p>
						</header>

						<p>The definition of "good" and "bad" weather is hghly subjective, but we decided on definitions based on a group consensus. Our initial naive
							definition of "bad" weather is as follows:
						</p>
						<ol class="default">
							<li>The average temperature was colder than usual – you might want to stay home on an especially cold winter day</li>
							<li>There is more rain or snow than usual – we prefer not getting our clothes wet most of the times</li>
					    </ol>
					
						<p>However, this definition is too naive as it does not capture the nuances in the definition of "good" or "bad" between each city. Someone in
						   LA, for example, might see any rain as "bad" weather whereas for a New Yorker, truly bad weather depends on the quantity of rain. This is depicted in the following plot. 
						   Indeed, there are as much bad weather days in Los Angeles 
						and Miami as New york, which could make Angelenos raise an eyebrow. In LA, calling a slight drizzle 'bad weather' might just be the biggest plot twist of the season!</p>
						</p>
					</section>
					<iframe class="responsive-plot" src="plots/weather_classification_naive.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
					<section>
					    <p>Therefore, we decided to redefine "good" and "bad" weather based on the average precipitation and temperature of each city. We chose to define to define it as the following for each city:</p>	

							<p>For cities such as Miami, Los Angeles (LA), and Atlanta:</p>
						<blockquote><strong>Precipitation Critera:</strong>
							We chose to define 'good weather' in these cities as days with precipitation levels below 25% of the city's average. This decision aligns with
							the general perception of these cities as having dry and sunny climates. Particularly in LA and Miami, lower precipitation is often indicative
							of more desirable weather conditions.<br>
							<strong>Temperature Critera:</strong>We considered days with average temperatures at or above the mean as 'good weather'.
							This criterion was selected in light of the warmer climates of these cities, where higher temperatures are generally more typical and often
							preferred by residents and visitors.
						</blockquote>

						<p>For the other cities:</p>
						<blockquote><strong>Precipitation and Temperature Criteria:</strong> We categorized weather as 'bad' when precipitation was at or below the mean
							and average temperatures were at or below the city's mean. This classification is reminiscent for that of the naive model. This is a valid
							assumption as these cities have a wider range of weather conditions, especially cold winters. It takes into account the higher precipitation
							and more extreme temperatures (both high and low) that these cities often experience.</blockquote>
							
						<p>Using these two assumptions, we get the following, much more reasonable, classification of good or bad weather.</p>

						<iframe class="responsive-plot" src="plots/weather_classification.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

						<p>We can see that our method aligns with the general perception of these cities' weather conditions. For example, Miami, LA, and Atlanta have a
							higher proportion of 'good weather' days than that of other cities, which is consistent with the perception of these cities as having more
							desirable weather conditions. On the other hand, cities such as Chicago and New York have a higher proportion of 'bad weather' days, which
							is in line with the perception of these cities as having more extreme weather conditions.</p>
						
						<p>That's it for the weather data! It's time to move onto the movie dataset, or if you have already, then the data story!</p>
